<h4 class="font-style" ><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong></h4>

  <p><em ><strong>Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee</strong></em> (born 8 June 1955),also known as TimBL, is an <strong >English computer scientist</strong>, best known as the inventor of the <em syle="bold"><strong>World Wide Web</strong></em>. He made a proposal for an <em> information management system </em>in March 1989, and he implemented the first successful communication between a <strong >Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)client and server</strong> via the Internet sometime around mid-November of that same year.</p>

  <p>Berners-Lee is the<em>director</em> of the<strong> World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</strong>, which oversees the continued development of the Web. He is also the <em>founder</em> of the <em>World Wide Web Foundation</em>, and is a senior researcher and holder of the founders chair at the <em>MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL)</em>. He is a <em>director of the Web Science Research Initiative (WSRI)</em>, and a member of the advisory board of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence.In 2011, he was named as a member the board of trustees of the Ford Foundation.</p>
<h4 class="font-style"><strong>Early Life History:</strong></h4>
<p>Born in 1955 in London, Berners-Lee’s parents were both mathematicians who were employed together on the team that built the <em>Manchester Mark I, one of the earliest computers</em>.</p>

<p>After attending school in London, Berners-Lee went on to study physics at Queen’s College, Oxford, where he built a computer with a soldering iron, TTL gates, an M6800 processor and an old television. (While at Oxford, he was caught hacking with a friend and was subsequently banned from using the university computer ). He received a first-class bachelor of arts degree in physics.</p>
<h4 class="font-style" ><strong>Career:</strong></h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>1976: </strong>He worked at Plessey Telecommunications  as a <em>programmer</em></li>
  <li><strong>1978: </strong>He joined D. G. Nash in Ferndown, Dorset, where he helped create <em>type-setting software for printers</em>.</li>
  <li><strong> 1980: </strong>June to December, Worked as an <em>independent contractor</em> at <strong>CERN</strong>.While in Geneva, he proposed a project based on the concept of <em>hypertext</em>, to facilitate <em>sharing and updating information</em> among researchers. To demonstrate it, he built a prototype system named <strong >ENQUIRE</strong></li>
    <li> <strong> Late 1980: </strong> Work at John Poole's Image Computer Systems, Ltd, in Bournemouth, Dorset.He ran the company's <em>technical side for three years</em>. The project he worked on was a <em>"real-time remote procedure call"</em> which gave him experience in <em>computer networking.</em></li>
  <li><strong>1984: </strong>He returned to CERN</li>
  <li><strong>1989: </strong> CERN was the <em>largest Internet node</em> in Europe, and Berners-Lee saw an opportunity to join <strong><em >hypertext </em></strong>with the Internet.And wrote his proposal in March 1989.</li>
  <li><strong>1990: </strong>Redistributed his proposal. It then was accepted by his manager, Mike Sendall.He used similar ideas to those underlying the ENQUIRE system to create the World Wide Web, for which he designed and built the first<em><strong> Web browser</strong></em>. His software also functioned as an <em>editor (called WorldWideWeb, running on the NeXTSTEP operating system), and the first Web server, CERN HTTPd (short for Hypertext Transfer Protocol daemon).</em></li>
  <li><strong>1991: </strong>The <em><strong>first web site</strong></em> built was at CERN within the border of France, and was <em >put online</em> on <em>6 August 1991</em> for the first time.</li>
  <li><strong>1994: </strong>Berners-Lee founded the <em><strong>W3C </strong></em>at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.He made his idea available freely, with <em>no patent and no royalties due.</em></li>
  <li><strong>2001: </strong>Berners-Lee became a patron of the East Dorset Heritage Trust, having previously lived in Colehill in Wimborne, East Dorset.</li>
  <li><strong>2004: </strong>December, he accepted a chair in computer science at the<em>School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Hampshire,</em> to work on the Semantic Web.</li>
  <li><strong>2009: June </strong>, <em>then-British Prime Minister Gordon Brown </em>announced Berners-Lee would work with the<em>UK government</em> to help make data more open and accessible on the Web, building on the work of the Power of Information Task Force.
    <strong>November</strong>, Berners-Lee launched the World Wide Web Foundation in order to <em>"advance the Web to empower humanity by launching transformative programs that build local capacity to leverage the Web as a medium for positive change."</em></li>
  <li><strong>2012: </strong> Berners-Lee is <em>president</em> of the <strong>Open Data Institute</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>2013: </strong>The <em><strong>Alliance for Affordable Internet (A4AI)</strong></em> was launched in October 2013 and Berners-Lee is leading the coalition of public and private organisations that includes Google, Facebook, Intel, and Microsoft.</li>
  <li><strong>2016: </strong>In October,he joined the <em><strong>Department of Computer Science</strong> at Oxford University as a professor and as a fellow of Christ Church, one of the Oxford colleges.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="font-style" ><strong>Awards and Honours:</strong></h3>
<p>Berners-Lee has received many awards and honours.</p>
<ul>
  <li>He was <em ><strong>Knighted</strong></em> in <strong>2004</strong> when he was promoted to <strong>Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE)</strong> in the New Year Honours<em> "for services to the global development of the Internet"</em>, and was invested formally on 16 July 2004.</li>
  <li>On <strong>13 June 2007</strong>, he received the <em >Order of Merit</em>, becoming <em>one of only 24 living members entitled to hold the honour</em>, and to use the post-nominals <strong>'O.M.'</strong> after their name.</li>
  <li>In 2012, Berners-Lee was among <em>the British cultural icons</em> selected by artist <em>Sir Peter Blake </em>to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork – <em>the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album cover </em>– to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life that he most admires to mark his 80th birthday.</li>
